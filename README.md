Temple Run clone for PC version

-PC version/clone of Temple Run game.
-I have used 3D Character from Unity Standard Assets Pack.
-Character is always having run speed, while player can move it left (A) or right (D), or can do a jump (space bar).
-When character passes through collision on a platform, new platform spawns.
-There are 3 different platforms to spawn, platform that continues straight, left or right.
-Switching left (turn left) is done by Q key, switching right (turn right) is done by E key.
-Platforms are not moving, only character is moving, while lava platform is moving as character is moving.
-Platforms character has passed will be deleted after 20 seconds.
-Platforms are spawning based on position of previous platform.
-There is chance of randomly spawning obstacles and coins on predefined spots on platforms.
-Cinemachine is used for camera following player.
